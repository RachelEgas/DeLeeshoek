# Teddy games

React App with cartoon animations and games for kids. 
Developed just for fun and to learn React-spring library for animations.

Used:
* create-react-app;
* styled-components;
* react-spring; ( all 5 hooks);
* functional components and react-hooks only.

During development I also have written an article about import and preloading of bunch of images:
